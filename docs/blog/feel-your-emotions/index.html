  Feel Your Emotions
</h1>
<p class="subtitle"><strong>2024-10-26</strong></p>
<p>FEEL YOUR EMOTIONS… It’ll be ok...</p>
<p>To set some groundwork, know that Feelings are caused by our Thoughts. Feelings are NOT caused by our Circumstances. Circumstances are facts outside us, like someone else’s words or actions, or the weather, or traffic, or someone else’s thoughts, or the news report.</p>
<p>Feelings/emotions are just vibrations in our body. They are different from sensations. Sensations start in our bodies (getting a sliver in your foot, touching a hot stove, pain in the abdomen caused by food poisoning, or a breeze on our cheek). The sensation from our nerves travels to our heads (signaling our brains that something is happening in our body). A Feeling or emotion starts in our heads (with a Thought) then travels to our body. Some examples could be: I have the Thought, “oh no, I think he hates me,” feels sad. Then my brain sends to my body the emotion/vibration of sadness. The Thought, “my house is in chaos (and it shouldn’t be)” could Feel frustrating, which my brain sends to my body in the form of frustration vibrations. I Feel happy when I think the thought, “this day is so awesome!” I have that Thought, then my brain sends the good vibrations to my body.</p>
<p>Our brains were wired to react to sensations and uncomfortable Feelings in the same way: This hurts, I might die, so we should freeze up or fight or run away. So much of what we’ve been taught tells us that uncomfortable Feelings are a problem, and that we shouldn’t have them, something has gone wrong, or something is wrong with us for Feeling it. Therefore, says society, we should avoid it with scrolling social media, drugs, alcohol, sex, shopping, or food; or we should  resist it and act like the Feeling isn’t there so shut the door on it and don’t think about it anymore (pushing down a beachball into the water); or we should act out on our Feeling by yelling, hitting, ignoring others, being snarky, etc.</p>
<p>The truth is that Feelings are part of the human experience. We’ve been given bodies that can handle all emotion. We are even supposed to have all these Feelings!</p>
<p>A helpful approach to uncomfortable emotions is the practice of Processing or Allowing them. Allow the emotion to come, don’t resist or avoid or act out on them. Allow the Feeling to come into your body. Get out of your head and Thoughts so you can watch the Feeling and notice it inside your body.</p>
<p>Think to yourself, “I am processing <strong><strong><strong>(this)</strong></strong></strong> Feeling.” Don’t try to fix it or get rid of it. Get curious. What sensations am I feeling right now in my body?</p>
<p>Start to describe the Feeling:</p>
<p>What does it look like?
What color is it?
What texture is it?
Is it fast or slow?
Hard or soft or sharp?
What shape is it?
Is it heavy or dense or light?</p>
<p>As you try to “see” it, many times it starts to dissipate and dissolve. Sometimes it comes back in waves. Just repeat the process every time a new wave breaks on your body.</p>
<p>Allow the uncomfortable vibration to be there in your body as you continue to live and go about your day. Notice the heaviness, hurt, and humming of the vibration. Notice it’s ability to restrict your breath, and tighten some part of your body. Notice. Tell yourself, “this is a vibration, and my body was made to handle it.”</p>
<p>Notice any desire to react, resist, or avoid it. Say the Feeling out loud or write it down. Don’t act on it, just acknowledge it and breathe.</p>
